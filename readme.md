- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
   - I did my best to ensure quality of the program by developing a robust testing suite. If we were able, User testing would be a valuable addition to our testing process.

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
   - I examined the requirements specified in the user requirements and formed my Junit tests to target the requirements. If user testing was added users could provide more requirements while testing the program and we could use their input to guide future developement. 

- How do I approach designing software?
   - I typically try to set up the program to be as simple and efficent as possible. After working on a variety of programs I can identify difficulties that are added to development when working on older legacy programs. This can lead to a decrease in results as we can create more issues while attempting to correct specific ones.
